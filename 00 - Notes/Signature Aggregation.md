# Signature Aggregation
- A cryptographic technique that is used to join two or more digital signatures
	- Given n signatures on n messages from n users, it is possible to aggregate all these signatures into a single signature whose size is constant in the number of users. 
- The aggregated signature acts as proof for the verifier that the n users did sign the n original messages
