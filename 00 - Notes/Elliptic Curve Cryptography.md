# Elliptic Curve Cryptography
- Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is an approach to[Public-key Cryptography](./Public-key Cryptography.md)based on the algebraic structure of[Elliptic Curve|elliptic curves](./Elliptic Curve|elliptic curves.md)over finite fields.
- It is considered the next generation of public-key cryptography because it provides a significantly more secure foundation than first generation public-key cryptography systems like RSA.
