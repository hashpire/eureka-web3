# P versus NP Problem
- A major unsolved problem in computer science
- $P$: all decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine using a polynomial amount of computation time, or polynomial time
- $NP$: all decision problems whose answer is "yes" and can be verified in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine, or problems that are solvable in polynomial time by a nondeterministic Turing machine
- The answer to the problem would determine whether problems that can be verified in polynomial time can also be solved in polynomial time. 
- It is widely believed that $P \neq NP$, which means that there are problems in $NP$ that are harder to compute than to verify and could not be solved in polynomial time, but their answers could be verified in polynomial time.
