# Filecoin Ecosystem Update 2020
## Filecoin's Mission
- To create a decentralized, efficient, and robust foundation for humanity's information â€” Humanity most valuable resource

## Goals
- Decentralize the Cloud
- Give users control of their data
- Turning data storage pricing into an efficient market, allow the network to set prices rather than a corporate pricing department
- Making storage verifiable
	- Ensure that when someone says they're storing your file, they are actually storing them
- Optimizing the world storage
	- The amount of data we generate is growing at an alarming rate, but only a tiny portion of the world's generated data is actually stored.
		- In 2020:  total of 58 ZB,  only 7% of global data is stored
		- In 2024:  expected to be a total of 175 ZB, where only 5% of global data is stored

### Summary
- Cloud companies control how data is stored and priced -> A global open market
- Content move right to the edge where it's needed the most by the set of clients

## Storage Provider
To be a storage provider
- Not only will you need to have disks, tapes, server admins, good connectivity and competitive pricing, you'll also need good customer support, sales and marketing.
- Filecoin offload the business related aspects so you can focus on the core tech.
- Filecoin vs AWS / Azure (Cloud) is like Airbnb vs Marriot / Hilton
