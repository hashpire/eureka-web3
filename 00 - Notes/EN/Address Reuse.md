# Address Reuse
- Address reuse harms the privacy of not only yourself, but also others — including those not related to the transaction

---

> “A new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner.”
> — Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System

## Examples
1. Everyone is able to see all your transactions if you use just one address
2. If an eCommerce shop reuses an address for all customers, we can see all customer transactions made to this shop
