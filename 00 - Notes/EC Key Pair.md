# EC Key Pair
An EC key pair consists of:
1. Private Key — A random positive integer
2. Public Key — A point on the elliptic curve [EC Point](./EC Point.md), which is the result of the[Elliptic Curve Arithmetic#Point Scalar Multiplication|point scalar multiplication](./Elliptic Curve Arithmetic#Point Scalar Multiplication|point scalar multiplication.md)of the private key and the base point of the elliptic curve
	- A public key can be represented in a[Compressed EC Public Key|compressed](./Compressed EC Public Key|compressed.md)or an[Uncompressed EC Public Key|uncompressed](./Uncompressed EC Public Key|uncompressed.md)form
