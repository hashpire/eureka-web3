# EC Key Pair
An EC key pair consists of:
1. Private Key — A random positive integer
2. Public Key — A point on the elliptic curve ([[EC Point]]), which is the result of the [[Elliptic Curve Arithmetic#Point Scalar Multiplication|point scalar multiplication]] of the private key and the base point of the elliptic curve
	- A public key can be represented in a [[Compressed EC Public Key|compressed]] or an [[Uncompressed EC Public Key|uncompressed]] form
