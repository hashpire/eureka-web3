# Public-key Cryptography
- Public-key cryptography is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of mathematically related keys called a private key and a public key.
	- Private keys are private — no one except its owner should know them.
	- Public keys are public — they may be known to others.
- Key pairs are generated using cryptographic algorithms based on[Trapdoor One-way Function|trapdoor one-way functions](./Trapdoor One-way Function|trapdoor one-way functions.md)
- The first public key cryptosystem was the RSA system of Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, which they published in 1978
