# Blockchain Wallet

-   Unlike real-world wallets, a blockchain wallet doesn't hold any cryptocurrencies.
-   Crypto digital assets and cryptocurrencies are secured by private keys. 
-   A blockchain wallet is a software application or a hardware device that does two main things:
	- Key Management: Generation, Storage, Use
	- Interact with the blockchain network
