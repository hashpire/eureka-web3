# Elliptic Curve Cryptography
- Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)%20is%20an%20approach%20to[Public-key%20Cryptography](./Public-key%20Cryptography.md)based%20on%20the%20algebraic%20structure%20of[Elliptic%20Curve|elliptic%20curves](./Elliptic%20Curve|ellipti%20curves.md)over finite fields.
- It is considered the next generation of public-key cryptography because it provides a significantly more secure foundation than first generation public-key cryptography systems like RSA.
