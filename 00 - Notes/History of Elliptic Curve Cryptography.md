# History of Elliptic Curve Cryptography
- In 1984, Hendrik Lenstra Jr. circulated a manuscript describing a new factorization method using elliptic curves.
- In 1985, Neal Koblitz and Victor Miller independently proposed using elliptic curves to create cryptosystems.
	- They suggested that the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem might be more difficult than the classical discrete logarithm problem modulo p. 
	- It might require smaller keys and run more efficiently than RSA because one could use smaller numbers
- The potential of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) was noted by Scott Vanstone and Ron Mullin, who had started a cryptographic company called Certicom in 1985.
- In the early 2000â€™s, the NSA made Elliptic curve its standard suite B algorithm for both encryption and signature and its use on low power devices has been shown to be much more scalable
