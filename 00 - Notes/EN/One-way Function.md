# One-way Function
- A one-way function is an invertible function that is easy to compute, but whose inverse is difficult to compute.
- Intuitively, a function is difficult to compute if any algorithm that attempts to compute the inverse in a “reasonable” amount of time will almost certainly fail.
- It is still not known whether one-way functions exist.
- Proof of the existence of one-way functions would simultaneously solve the[P versus NP Problem](./P%20versus%20NP%20Problem.md)
	- Their existence would prove that $P \neq NP$
