# Modulo
A term used to assert that two distinct mathematical objects can be regarded as equivalent — if their difference is accounted for by an additional factor.

For example, the statement
> A is the same as B modulo C 

means

> A and _B_ are the same — except for differences accounted for or explained by _C_.
