# Elliptic Curve Cryptography
- Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is an approach to [[Public-key Cryptography]] based on the algebraic structure of [[Elliptic Curve|elliptic curves]] over finite fields.
- It is considered the next generation of public-key cryptography because it provides a significantly more secure foundation than first generation public-key cryptography systems like RSA.
