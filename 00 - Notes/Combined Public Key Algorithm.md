# Combined Public Key Algorithm
- The combined public key algorithm (CPK) is an identity-based large-scale key management algorithm. 
- It can be used on any system that uses public key cryptography that has a special composite property. 
- Because typical blockchain systems use elliptic curve cryptography, which has this special composite property, the combined public-key algorithm can be applied to blockchain wallets to solve large-scale key management problems.
